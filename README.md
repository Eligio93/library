# Library

## Description of the project
This project simulates a library Web App. The different inputs of each book are collected through a form and each book is displayed in the main area. Key-point of the project is to implement each book with a toggle switch able to set the status of the book on "Read" or "Unread", using the prototype function.

## Struggles point
While building this project I 've realized how important is to maintain clean code and assign the right name to all the variables. At some point I've got completely lost in my own code, reason why, at some point, I had to restart everything again, especially on the javascript part. I had some trouble also on identify items on screen. For example when I'm clicking a toggle or a delete("X") button, how can i link that to the actual considered book? I've implemented some "click" event listener on the page but that can still return error in the console, even if the app works properly.

## Conclusion
On top of the functions to add, remove and modify the read status of the book, I've also implemented a function on the App that moves the book in the right section of the page depending on the read status of the book. I also used the function prototype as requested for this project but my question is..could I have done the same thing with a normal function instead of using prototype?
